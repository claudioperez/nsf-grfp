  abstract = {In the building industry, building data such as objects and processes are described in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model schema to support a neutral data exchange format for BIM tools interoperability. While IFC specification has been encoded in ifcXML format by buildingSMART to support XML-based data transmission, there is a lack of studies on the implementation of IFC specification using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) serialization. JSON is a key-value style lightweight data exchange format that has higher parsing efficiency than XML and due to the inadequacies of XML, JSON has been widely used in Web applications, specifically in Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) Web services. This paper highlights the need for JSON implementation of IFC specification and introduces ifcJSON Schema and its data content. The main objective of this study is to outline how IFC specification can be represented in JSON format. Therefore, the study explains the implementation of the IFC standard as a JSON schema to guide the creation of JSON documents. The ifcJSON documents can be used for web-based data transfer as an alternative to XML documents. Since current IFC specification release is IFC4 Add1, the implementation of ifcJSON4 schema is specified and guidelines for generating and validating ifcJSON documents are described. Additionally, this paper implements ifcJSON4 schema in a use case within the precast concrete domain by indicating the data content for a precast building element with its corresponding geometry representation, product placement, and owner history data. The analysis of results indicates that ifcJSON4 schema developed in this paper is a valid JSON schema that can guide the creation of valid ifcJSON documents to be used for web-based data transfer and to improve interoperability of Cloud-based BIM applications.},

  abstract = {Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a tool that systematically implements the chain rule of differentiation to obtain the derivatives of functions calculated by computer programs. In this paper, it is assessed as a tool for engineering design. The paper discusses the forward and reverse modes of AD, their computing requirements, as well as approaches to implementing AD. It continues with the application of two different tools to two medium-size structural analysis problems to generate sensitivity information typically necessary in an optimization or design situation. The paper concludes with the observation that AD is to be preferred to finite differencing in most cases, as long as sufficient computer storage is available; in some instances, AD may be the alternative to consider in lieu of analytical sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract = {A key component to the success of deep learning is the use of gradient-based optimization. Deep learning practitioners compose a variety of modules together to build a complex computational pipeline that may depend on millions or billions of parameters. Differentiating such functions is enabled through a computational technique known as automatic differentiation. The success of deep learning has led to an abstraction known as differentiable programming, which is being promoted to a first-class citizen in many programming languages and data analysis frameworks. This often involves replacing some common non-differentiable operations (eg. binning, sorting) with relaxed, differentiable analogues. The result is a system that can be optimized from end-to-end using efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms. A differentiable analysis could be optimized in this way — basic cuts to final fits all taking into account full systematic errors and automatically analyzed. This Snowmass LOI outlines the potential advantages and challenges of adopting a differentiable programming paradigm in high-energy physics.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the simulation of RC members with a three-dimensional (3D), 2-node beam finite element (FE) that includes warping of the cross section. A previously proposed FE formulation is extended to allow the description of structural members with softening material behavior. The governing equations are derived from an extended four-field Hu-Washizu variational principle, with independent interpolation of the warping displacement field from the rigid section displacement, the generalized section deformation, and the material stress fields. A fiber discretization is used for the numerical integration of the nonlinear material response of the composite cross sections with a new plastic-damage model for the material description of the concrete fibers. The element state determination is based on a numerically efficient predictor-corrector scheme for the evolution of the internal variables of damage plasticity. The paper concludes with correlation studies of RC structural members under monotonic and cyclic loading and discusses the effect of cross-section warping on the damage evolution.

Commonly used RAD algorithms such as backpropagation, however, are complex and stateful, hindering deep understanding, improvement, and parallel execution. This paper develops a simple, generalized AD algorithm calculated from a simple, natural specification. The general algorithm is then specialized by varying the representation of derivatives. In particular, applying well-known constructions to a naive representation yields two RAD algorithms that are far simpler than previously known. In contrast to commonly used RAD implementations, the algorithms defined here involve no graphs, tapes, variables, partial derivatives, or mutation. They are inherently parallel-friendly, correct by construction, and usable directly from an existing programming language with no need for new data types or programming style, thanks to use of an AD-agnostic compiler plugin.},

Because the system is fully compatible with Autograd, it allows forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation of Python functions to arbitrary order. Because JAX supports structured control flow, it can generate code for sophisticated machine learning algorithms while maintaining high performance. We show that by combining JAX with Autograd and Numpy we get an easily programmable and highly performant ML system that targets CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, capable of scaling to multi-core Cloud TPUs.},

Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework is the most accurate general-purpose learned physics simulator to date, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.},

The implementation of a beam-column finite element is reduced to the state determination procedure for a basic system that displaces and rotates with the element. An abstraction for geometric nonlinearity represents the kinematic and equilibrium transformations between the basic and global reference systems, while an abstraction for force-deformation response represents material nonlinearity for the basic system. Separate objects encapsulate material stress-strain behavior and cross-sectional integration in order to increase the modeling flexibility for computing the response of fiber-discretized cross sections. Multiple forms of distributed plasticity in beam-column elements are incorporated in the framework through objects that encapsulate one-dimensional quadrature rules. Software design patterns are utilized to create complex beam-column simulation models by composition of basic building blocks. The modeling flexibility of the software design is demonstrated through the simulation of a reinforced concrete column.},

It is assumed that plane sections remain plane and normal to the longitudinal axis. The effects of shear and bond-slip are, thus, presently neglected. The non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the element derives from the constitutive relations of concrete and reinforcing steel fibres into which each section is divided. The element formulation is flexibility-based and relies on force interpolation functions that strictly satisfy the equilibrium of bending moments and axial force along the element. Since the element does not make use of displacement interpolation functions, an iterative algorithm is needed for the determination of the resisting forces during the element state determination. The proposed algorithm is accurate and stable, even in the presence of strength loss, and is, thus, capable of tracing very well the highly non-linear behaviour of R/C members under cyclic load combinations of bending moment and axial force.},
